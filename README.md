# Statistical Inference Project

The project consists of two parts:

* A simulation exercise.
* Basic inferential data analysis.

## Part 1

In this project we will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. 

We illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. 


## Part 2

Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
